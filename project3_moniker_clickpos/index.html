			Luna Maurer is a graphic designer with strong interests in conditional design, mainly focused on the relations between automated and manual design processes. Her interests lie in technological developments that change our media into fluid digital environments and finding design solutions for it. She applies her approach of designing environments, conditions and tools to all kinds of media: dynamic media (web, tools, animation and video) but also to print, installations and performances. She studied Graphic Design at the Fachhochschule für Gestaltung in Pforzheim (Germany), at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam and then completed further study at the Sandberg Institute in Amsterdam. Her work has been exhibited among others at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, Museum de Paviljoens, Almere, London Design Museum. Luna Maurer currently collaborates with Jonathan Puckey, Roel Wouters and Edo Paulus, developing and discussing their working methods under the term ‘Conditional Design’. <a href="http://www.lunamaurer.com" target="_blank">www.lunamaurer.com</a>
